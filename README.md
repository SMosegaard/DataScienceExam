# Exam: Data Science, Prediction, and Forecasting

This repository contains the code for my exam project in the course "Data Science, Prediction, and Forecasting" as a part of my Master in Cognitive Science.

## 🔧 Setup and installation guide

To set up the project and ensure reproducibility, follow these steps:

### 1.  Clone the repository
Start by cloning the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```python
$ git clone "https://github.com/SMosegaard/DataScience_Exam.git"
```
### 2. Set up the virtual environment
Next, execute the ```setup.sh``` script to create a virtual environment and install all necessary dependencies listed in ```requirements.txt```:
```python
$ source setup.sh
``` 
You are now working within the virtual environment.

navigate into the src/ folder and execute the bash script for the lag-llama.

```python
$ cd src
$ source lagllama_setup.sh
```
This will clone the lag-llama repo inside the src folder.


## 👩‍💻 Get started
After setting up the project, follow these steps ....

```python
$ python tune.py -m {arima/...}
```
```python
$ python test.py -m {arima/...}
```



.........


When finished, deactivate the virtual environment:
```python
$ deactivate
```


## 📂 Repository Overview
The project is structured to support a full forecasting workflow, including data prepreations, model tuning, evaluation, and visualization. Here is a breakdown of the project structure:
